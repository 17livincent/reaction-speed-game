<p>
  This is a command-line-based reaction speed game written in C++.
</p>
<p>
  game.h includes all of the function definitions and parameters.  
  game.cpp merely uses the code from game.h.  The goal was to have as little unique code in game.cpp as possible.
</p>
<h2>To use:</h2>
<p>
  Compile game.cpp with g++ (g++ game.cpp) and run the executable.
</p>
<h2>How to play:</h2>
<p>
First, you will see "Press ENTER to play",  Hit the ENTER button when you are ready to react.
When you see "get set...", be ready to hit the ENTER key when "GO" is printed.
After, it will show you the time difference between when "GO" is printed and when you react.
