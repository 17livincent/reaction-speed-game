<p>
  This is a command-line-based reaction speed game written in C++.
</p>
<p>
  reactionspeedgame.h includes all of the function definitions and parameters.  
  play.cpp merely uses the code from reactionspeedgame.h.  That file is the most important.
</p>
<h2>To use:</h2>
<p>
  Use the makefile to create the executable <code>play</code>.
</p>
<h2>How to play:</h2>
<p>
  First, you will see "Press ENTER to play".  Hit the ENTER button when you are ready to react.
  When you see "get set...", be ready to hit the ENTER key when "GO" is printed.
  After, it will show you the time difference between when "GO" is printed and when you react.
  It will then print the average reaction time, as well as the iteration number.
  The game will automatically repeat.  To quit, simply type CTRL C.
